# Android-APK
Official Google Play Signed APK's of the xigxag app. 
Download from here and install on any non-Google Play equipped device

Note: The app is designed to function with Google Play Services installed, so certains serives like In App Purchase will not work if you don't have Google Play Services installed.
The app queries the Google Play Services to determine your location.  Your catalogue view will be restricted to books with rights in the region you have set in Android localisation.

To purchase books, which you can then listen to in the app, go to http://xigxag.co.uk and purchase via our catalogue - books will appear in My Books in the app.

There is no automated mechanism to update users of new versions of the app, so please bookmark this page and check here on a regular basis to get updates
